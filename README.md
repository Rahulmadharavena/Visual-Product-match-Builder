Full-stack deployment

API debugging and production-level issue fixing

📝 Project Overview

Visual Product Match Builder is an AI-powered product-matching application that identifies visually similar products from an uploaded image.
The app is designed for e-commerce platforms to recommend products based on image input, just like Flipkart, Amazon, or Myntra.

Users upload any product image (shoes, clothes, phones, bags, jeans, home items, etc.), and the system finds visually similar items from the dataset using ML + feature embedding.

🚀 Key Features
✔ 1. Upload Product Image

Users can upload any JPEG/PNG image to analyze.

✔ 2. AI-based Visual Matching

Extracts image features

Compares them with dataset items

Shows top visually similar products

✔ 3. Supabase Dataset Integration

Products stored in Supabase table

Image URLs + product details fetched in real-time

Efficient querying and fast search

✔ 4. Modern UI with Smooth Experience

Responsive UI

Clean frontend

Instant preview of uploaded image

Real-time loading state

✔ 5. Full-Stack Deployment

Frontend: Vercel

Backend: Node/Express (or API routes)

Database: Supabase

Dataset: 50–100 product items (Footwear, Phones, Home, Clothing, etc.)
